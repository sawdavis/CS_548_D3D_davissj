## Software Dependencies Overview
You will need to install the following manually:
- C++ compilers
- CMake
- Miniconda
- PCL
- Visual Code


The rest of the dependencies will be automatically fetched by CMake.

You will then need to create a miniconda environment.

## C++ Compilers
* ***For Windows:*** Download and install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)  
  * Install the C++ toolchain
  * Under "Individual Components", search for and add: ```C++ MFC for latest v143 build tools (x86 & x64)```
* ***For Mac:*** The included Clang g++ compilers should theoretically work.

## CMake
You will need **version 3.24** or higher.

* ***For Windows:***
  * Download the CMake installer from [here](https://cmake.org/download/).
  * If given the option, make sure to **"Add CMake to the system PATH"**.
* ***For Mac:***
  * Download the latest "macOS 10.13 or later" .dmg from [here](https://cmake.org/download/)
  * Install Cmake and run it
  * Select ```"Tools" -> "How to Install for Command Line Use"```
  * Copy the second option into a terminal: ```sudo "/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui" --install```


## Python (Miniconda) Installation

Miniconda is a smaller version of Anaconda, which is a distribution of Python.  You will need to at least install Miniconda on a local machine (we will discuss how to make a portable version later in these instructions).

### Windows

First, download the latest installer for Windows [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/).

Run the installer; I would install it for All Users (especially if your username has spaces in it).  I installed it into ```C:/miniconda3```.

Open "Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)" **as an administrator**; you should see ```(base)``` to the left of your terminal prompt.

### Linux

First, download the latest version:
```
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
```

Next, install it into your home directory (default options are fine):
```
~/miniconda3/bin/conda init bash
```

Close and reopen the terminal; you should see ```(base)``` to the left of your terminal prompt.

### Mac
Open up a terminal.

If you are on an **Intel Mac**:
```
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```
If you are on an **M1 Mac**:
```
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
sh Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh
```
Close and reopen the terminal; you should see ```(base)``` to the left of your terminal prompt.

## Python Environment Creation

Create your DATA3D environment:
```
conda create -n DATA3D python=3.11
```

Before installing any packages to the new environment, activate it:
```
conda activate DATA3D
```

```(DATA3D)``` should now be to the left of your terminal prompt.

## Installing Packages

***For Windows:*** Open "Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)" **as an administrator**.  

***For Linux:*** Make sure the commands that follow are run using ``sudo``.

Activate your environment:
```
conda activate DATA3D
```

### Updating pip
On Linux in particular, with your environment activated, make sure pip is updated:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

### Installing PyTorch
With ```DATA3D``` activated, you will need to install PyTorch for deep learning.  

The latest instructions for installing PyTorch may be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

#### CUDA-Enabled PyTorch
If you have an NVIDIA graphics card (or intend to run this environment on a machine with one), you will want to install the CUDA-enabled version of PyTorch.

***NOTE:*** On Linux, a version of Open3D may be installed that is pytorch-enabled, allowing usage of Open3D-ML.  However, accordingly to the documentation, you must install ```torch==2.2.2+cu121``` and ```torchvision==0.17.2+cu121```.  For consistency, we will use these versions for Windows and Mac as well.

The following instructions are for **CUDA version 12.1**.

##### Windows

```
pip3 install torch==2.2.2+cu121 torchvision==0.17.2+cu121 torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

##### Linux

```
pip3 install torch==2.2.2+cu121 torchvision==0.17.2+cu121 torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

#### CPU/Mac PyTorch
If you do NOT have an NVIDIA card (and/or are on a Mac), you will need to settle for the default installation:

```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

### Verifying PyTorch
To verify Pytorch works correctly:
```
python -c "import torch; x = torch.rand(5, 3); print(x); print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```
You should see an array printed.  

If you have an NVIDIA card and installed the CUDA version of PyTorch, you should also see the word ```True``` (otherwise, ```False``` is expected).

### Installing Open3D
To install Open3D:
```
pip3 install open3d
```
This should also install Open3D-ML.

### Verifying Open3D
To verify Open3D has been installed correctly:
```
python -c "import open3d as o3d; print(o3d.__version__)"

python -c "import open3d as o3d; mesh = o3d.geometry.TriangleMesh.create_sphere(); mesh.compute_vertex_normals(); o3d.visualization.draw(mesh, raw_mode=True)"
```
First, the version of Open3D installed should print out.  Then, you should see a visualization window pop up.

To verify the command-line applications work:
```
open3d example visualization/draw
```
Similarly, a series of visualization windows should pop up.

### Verifying Open3D-ML
To verify Open3D-ML has been installed correctly:
```
python -c "import open3d.ml.torch as ml3d"
```
***Under Linux***, this line should execute without errors.

### Installing Other Python Packages

Then, run the following commands to install the necessary packages for this course:
```
pip3 install tensorboard
pip3 install py3dtiles
pip3 install deepgeo
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install scikit-learn scikit-image 
pip3 install matplotlib 
pip3 install pytest
conda install conda-pack
```

### Python Environment Troubleshooting

* If you need to remove the DATA3D environment (the LOCAL version, not the portable one):
```
conda remove --name DATA3D --all
```

* If you encounter path issues (where conda isn't found once you activate an environment), open an Anaconda prompt as admin and try the following to add conda to your path globally: 
```
conda init
```

## PCL
To install the **Point Cloud Library (PCL)**, we will have to either compile it from source (Windows) or install it via a package manager (Mac).

### Windows
We will use **Vcpkg**, which is a package manager for Windows.

**PLEASE NOTE: the compilation process takes up a lot of time (hours) and space (~108GB).**

1. Open a **Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022** ***as an Administrator***.
2. cd to a folder where you can safely download and compile sources (e.g., ```C:/Code```).
3. Clone the Vcpkg project and run the bootstrap script:
```
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
.\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```
4. Compile PCL (THIS WILL TAKE A WHILE):
```
.\vcpkg install pcl[visualization] --triplet x64-windows --host-triplet x64-windows
```
Add --recurse option if you are rebuilding it with new features.

If you need to start over:
```
.\vcpkg remove pcl
```

5. Add a system environment variable:
   - ***Name:*** MY_VCPKG_ROOT
   - ***Value:*** "C:/Code/vcpkg"

### Mac
1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
2. Run the following: ```brew install pcl```

## Visual Code
I strongly recommend Visual Code as your IDE.
* [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install Visual Code
  * I suggest enabling the context menu options.
  * ***For Mac:*** Follow [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)
* Install the following extensions:
  * **"C/C++ Extension Pack"** by Microsoft
  * **"Python Extension Pack"** by Don Jayamanne  
  * **"Git Graph"** by mhutchie
  * **"Markdown All in One"** by Yu Zhang

A terminal can always be created/opened with ```View menu -> Terminal```.  However, if you need to restart, click the garbage can icon on the terminal window to destroy it.

***For Windows:*** Change your default terminal from Powershell to Command Prompt:
1. ```View menu -> Command Palette -> "Terminal: Select Default Profile"```
2. Choose ```"Command Prompt"```
3. Close any existing terminals in Visual Code

Once you open a project, to make sure you are using the correct Python interpreter:
1. Close any open terminals with the garbage can icon
2. Open a .py file
3. ```View -> Command Palette -> "Python: Select interpreter"```
4. Choose the one located at under the ```DATA3D``` environment.
5. If the GPU is not being utilized (or you see errors about paths to CUDA libraries not being found), type the following in your terminal to manually activate your environment: ```DATA3D\Scripts\activate.bat``` (you will need whatever path is before ```DATA3D```)

### Portable Visual Code
Go [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and download the **zip version** of Visual Code for your platform (most likely x64).
Unpack it to your USB drive.  Inside the folder for Visual Code, create a ```data``` folder:

This will cause Visual Code to store extensions and settings locally.

To run Visual Code:

***For Windows:*** double-click on this version of ```Code.exe```.

***For Linux/Mac:*** run ```./code```
